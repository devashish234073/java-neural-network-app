# java-neural-network-app

This is a java based neural network app based on https://towardsdatascience.com/first-neural-network-for-beginners-explained-with-code-4cfd37e06eaf implementation which is in python.

The same Perceptron implementation is used to implement or, and and xor gate and a asic logic of checking if age is less than 18, while 60 rounds of training is sufficient to teach 'age>18 logic' and 10 rounds of training for 'or' and 'and' gates. It wasn't able to train itself even after 1000 round of training for xor gate.
